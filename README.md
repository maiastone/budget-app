##Description  
A budgeting app for kids using React, Firebase, Webpack, and Enzyme. It allows for easy input of monthly budgeted expenses.  Once the budgets are set - the user can input actual expenses.  As a result, the user will see a graph on the home page showing how much money they have to spend for the month on each item.  A reports page shows weekly, monthly, and annual budgets, as well as allowing for an input of allowance, to be used as a tool to determine how much the user needs to receive or how much they need to cut expenses.
